## Hi, 👋🏻

This project has been developed by [@cjjouanne] (https://github.com/cjjouanne) to provide notifications about the daily operating program for power generators delivered by the National Electric Coordinator of Chile. 

> ⚠️ This is an independent project, and it does not take responsability of problems generated as a result of its malfunction.
